# Census income
Here I analyze the data taken from survey by Cencus Bureau. Survey is dedicated to show what kind of factors affect on peoples income.

The dataset was used to obtain data about coonection of different life factors, to compare them and describe how they affect each other.

Library used for visual part is Seaborn.
